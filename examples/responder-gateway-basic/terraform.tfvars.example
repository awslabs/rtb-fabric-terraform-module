# RTB Fabric Responder Gateway Basic Example Configuration
# 
# SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:
# 1. Copy this file: cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars
# 2. Edit terraform.tfvars with your specific values
# 3. Run: terraform init && terraform plan && terraform apply

# REQUIRED: Network configuration
# Provide your VPC, subnets, and security groups manually
vpc_id = "vpc-01234567890abcdef"
subnet_ids = ["subnet-01234567890abcdef", "subnet-fedcba0987654321"]
security_group_ids = ["sg-01234567890abcdef"]

# REQUIRED: Domain name for the responder gateway
# This is typically your load balancer's DNS name
domain_name = "my-load-balancer.elb.us-east-1.amazonaws.com"

# NOTE: This example uses manual network configuration instead of auto-discovery.
# It's suitable when you want full control over networking or when your
# infrastructure doesn't follow the EKS cluster tagging conventions.
#
# Application settings (port 31234, HTTP protocol) use sensible defaults
# and don't need configuration.
